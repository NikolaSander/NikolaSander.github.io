I developed an [interactive visualisation](http://www.german-migration.info) of internal migration in Germany together with [Ramon Bauer](https://twitter.com/metropop_eu) and [Johannes Schmidt](http://null2.net). The newspaper [DIE WELT](http://www.welt.de) published a nice story about the ["renaissance of the metropolitan areas"](http://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article129117096/Junge-Menschen-ziehen-massenhaft-in-die-Metropolen.html) on June 17. I also got a [journal article](http://www.comparativepopulationstudies.de/index.php/CPoS/article/view/89/174) published that introduces a new dataset and discusses the key trends since 1995.

### How to read the circular migration plot

Origins and destinations are represented by the circleâ€™s segments. Each region/county is assigned a colour. Flows have the same colour as their origin and the width indicates their size. The direction of the flow is also shown by the white space between flow and destination. Only directional flows with at least 1,000 migrants are shown, and only flows between counties that had movements (inflows + outflows) of more than 12,000 people in 2010 are included.
