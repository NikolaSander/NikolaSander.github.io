The global flow of people is a critical component of global human capital projections, especially the intensities of country-to-country flows and the characteristics of people with regards to age, sex and education.
<br>
<br>
Mostly due to the lack of adequate data, assumptions are commonly constrained to net-migration flows where migrants’ education is assumed to be proportional to the population in their country of origin.
<br>
<br>
Because of strong selection effects, these assumptions are known to introduce inaccuracies when projecting populations by level of educational attainment.
<br>
<br>
At the Wittgenstein Centre, we carry out global population projections using directional migration probabilities in a multi-regional cohort-component framework.
<br>
<br>
We draw on a unique new set of estimates of global bilateral migration flows for the 5-year period 2005-10 developed by my colleague Guy J. Abel ([find his latest publication here][2]). We combine these flows with the “Database on Immigrants in OECD and non-OECD Countries ([DIOC][3])” to estimate education differentials in country-specific immigration and emigration flows.
<br>
<br>
The results of the Wittgenstein Centre global human capital projections are documented in a major volume under the title “World Population and Human Capital in the 21st Century”, which is scheduled for publication in early 2014 by Oxford University Press.
<br>
<br>
Our population projections underly the recently published 2013 [United Nations Human Development Report][4].
