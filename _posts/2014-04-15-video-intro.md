A very pleasant way to avoid death by PowerPoint in conference presentations is to use visuals! Whiteboard animations allow you to visualise almost any complex method or finding in a way that is easily understandable by your audience (more details on the power of visuals <a title="Huffingtonpost" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/phil-simon/the-persuasive-power-of-v_b_5093192.html" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a title="HBR" href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/04/what-i-learned-watching-150-hours-of-ted-talks/" target="_blank">here</a>). An animated presentation video is definitely an effective combination of verbal and visual information.

This 4 minute video introduces our research on quantifying global international migration flows, which was published in <a title="Science" href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6178/1520" target="_blank">Science </a>on March 28, 2014 (free access <a title="The Global Flow of People" href="http://www.global-migration.info" target="_blank">here</a>). I produced the video using <a title="GoAnimate" href="http://goanimate.com/" target="_blank">GoAnimate </a>within 2 days. Making such animated whiteboard videos doesn't require any magic, just some good ideas on how to visualise complex content, and a great online tool such as GoAnimate. (please turn on your speakers)
