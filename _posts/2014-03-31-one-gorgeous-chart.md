Social scientists don't get accepted into the holy halls of [Science](http://www.sciencemag.org/) or [Nature](http://www.nature.com) too often. It requires novel and broadly important findings on a topic that is of interest to the scientific community and the general public.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps the most difficult thing about getting published is to catch the editor's attention in the blink of an eye. Title & abstract are crucial elements of a paper, and if a crisp-clear title & abstract grabbed enough of the editors attention to get him/her to quickly scan the paper, great visuals are more likely than endless jargon to persuade him/her to actually read the whole thing.
<br>
<br>
Effective data visualisations in scientific papers not only help to get through the review process, they are also key to getting attention by the media and, subsequently, the general public. With journalists or Twitter users, you might only have *half* a blink of an eye to catch their attention.
<br>
<br>
That sounds almost impossible to accomplish with social science research, doesn't it? Well, no! But my experience tells me that it requires some effort and out-of-the-box thinking.
<br>
<br>
My colleague [Guy Abel](http://www.oeaw.ac.at/vid/staff/staff_guy_abel.shtml‎) and I published a paper on [Quantifying Global International Migration Flows](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6178/1520) in *Science * on March 28 ([go here for free access](http://www.global-migration.info). But the journey didn't end there. Our work has been picked up by the international media and spread further via Twitter, which gave our research a much wider coverage than we could have ever imagined.
<br>
<br>
It became pretty clear pretty quickly that **one gorgeous chart** of migration between 50 countries (shown below) was playing a key role in spreading the word. First featured in a [story by Nick Stockton](http://qz.com/192440) ([@StocktonSays](https://twitter.com/StocktonSays‎)) in [Quartz](http://qz.com/) (The Atlantic), the chart appeared on more than 50 websites/blogs and several thousand Tweets in the week following publication.
<br>
<br>
The one gorgeous chart is part of a whole [gallery](http://www.nikolasander.net/dataviz/gallery) of circular migration plots that I've created. About 1.5 years ago, I was so frustrated with the lack of progress in [geography/GIS](http://www.gislounge.com/overview-flow-mapping/) to visualise flow data, that I decided to look outside the discipline. Martin Krzywinski's [Circos](http://circos.ca) inspired me to ditch the map (a hard thing to do for geographers!) and *go circular*.
<br>
<br>
After a year and a bit of tweaking the configuration files in Circos and playing with different input data formats (see here for details on how to do plots yourself), I had created a visualisation technique that let Guy's new migration flow estimates shine in a way that brings out their best: global coverage and comparability.
<br>
<br>
So, the equation is simple: *important topic + unique new data of global coverage + effective, eye-catching visualisation + surprising findings + a fantastic team + a bit of luck = publication in top-tier journal + successful science communication.*
