The level of media attention our research on The Global Flow of People has received since Guy Abel and I published our paper [Quantifying Global International Migration Flows](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6178/1520) in *Science* on March 28 is absolutely mind blowing!

Like most success stories, [The Global Flow of People](http://www.global-migration.info) has been a fantastic group effort by me, [Ramon Bauer][1], [Guy Abel](http://www.oeaw.ac.at/vid/staff/staff_guy_abel.shtml‎), [Null2][2] and [Elvira Stein][3]. Thanks also to the [Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital](http://www.oeaw.ac.at/wic) and the   [Vienna Institute of Demography](http://www.oeaw.ac.at/vid) for their support.

**Here's a selection of all the stories and blog posts that have popped up across the globe.**
