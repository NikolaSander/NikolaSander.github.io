One of my current research projects involves the study interregional migration flows in Germany and how patterns have changed over the last 15 years. Such time series analyses have long been hindered by the lack of suitable data.
<br>
<br>
To overcome this obstacle, I developed the **German Interal Migration (GIM) Database**. The database holds annual inter-county (german: Kreise) migration flows for a temporally harmonised geography of 397 regions covering the period 1995 to 2010. Using GIS overlay techniques, I minimised errors due to boundary changes and redistribution of ethnic Germans (Sp√§taussiedler).
<br>
<br>
The data provide a more comprehensive picture of the spatial structure of interregional migration in Germany and how it has changed since reunification.

A more detailed discussion of the database and key results are published in a paper in Comparative Population Studies titled [Internal migration in Germany, 1995-2010: new insights into East-West migration and re-urbanization](http://www.comparativepopulationstudies.de/index.php/CPoS/article/view/89/174). The flow matrices are available in the supplementary materials.

*Data specifications:* Counts represent the annual number of migration events across county boundaries. Within-county moves were not reported. The data are disaggregated by 6 age groups and gender. Age refers to the age at the time of the move. Moves of foreign citizens are included. The migration data used to derive these flow matrices were drawn from the German population register and kindly provided by DESTATIS.
