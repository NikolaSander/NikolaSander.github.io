Our new interactive data visualisation available at <a href="http://www.global-migration.info" target="_blank">global-migration.info</a> offers you unique information on international migration flows at your fingertips. Coded by <a href="http://null2.net/" target="_blank">Null2</a> using <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">d3.js</a>, our tool called <a href="http://www.global-migration.info" target="_blank">The Global Flow of People</a> allows the public, policy-makers, and scientists to explore for themselvesÂ where everyone was migrating in the world between 1990 and 2010. Give it a try! Hover your mouse over the graphic below, click on a coloured segment of the circle, and start exploring!
