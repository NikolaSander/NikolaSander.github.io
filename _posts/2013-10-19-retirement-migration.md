My PhD thesis contributes to a better understanding of the dynamics of retirement migration and the likely future trajectory of retirement migration as Australiaâ€™s baby boomers enter retirement.

A suite of state-of-the-art statistical methods were applied to cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets. The results demonstrate that the incidence and timing of retirement migration is closely related to the transition to retirement, and that large cohort size does not have a negative effect on migration. The impact of retirement migration among the boomers on regional population age structures is projected to be strongest in the retirement destinations of south-east Queensland and northern NSW.
