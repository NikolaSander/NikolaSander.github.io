Here you find a selection of circular migration plots that I've created in 2013/14. Frustrated with the lack of progress in the area of [geography/GIS](http://www.gislounge.com/overview-flow-mapping/) to visualise flow data, I decided to look outside the discipline and, luckily, came across Martin Krzywinski's [Circos](http://circos.ca). I ditched the map and decided to go circular.

    Circular plot of migration flows within and between world regions in 2005-10. Only flows with at least 70,000 migrants are shown. The outer stacked bars provide additional information on the number of immigrants by origin region (inner bar), and emigrants by destination (outer bar). For receiving countries with a net migration gain, the inner bar is higher/longer than the outer bar. Image by Nikola Sander, Wittgenstein Centre, Vienna. More details at www.global-migration.info
