There's a new rock star tool for interactive online visualizations that I discovered recently thanks to my colleagues at [Metropop.eu](http://www.metropop.eu/) and [Null2](http://null2.net/): [D3.js â€“ Data-Driven Documents](http://d3js.org/).

With Adobe Flash being a thing of the past, d3.js lets you create really cool custom-made interactive plots that can be shown on all sorts of devices (smartphone, tablet, laptop). 

We can even create interactive presentation slides that can be shown in any browser using the new JavaScript slides frameworks like [reveal.js](http://revealjs.com/). How exciting is that! No more boring Powerpoints!

Learning d3 means diving into html5, css and Javascipt all at once. Hence, my learning curve is very steep, but Scott Murray's excellent book ([online version)](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/index.html) on visualizations with d3 helped me to accomplish my first task: To include Mike Bostock's [chord diagram](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062006) into my blog. Here it is. Hurray!
