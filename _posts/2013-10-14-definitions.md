My personal migration history highlights the fallacies of official statistics on migration flows. Depending on how you define migration, I've moved between 2 and 11 times in the past 10 years; often with all my belongings on my Troopy's roof rack.

Data on migrant stock (i.e. people living outside their country of birth) would suggest that I've been a migrant for 9 years and 6 months (out of 10 years).
<br>
<br>
Using the UN definition of a migrant that states that a (long-term) migrant is a person who moves to a country other than that of his/her usual residence for a period of at least 12 months, so that the country of destination becomes his/her new country of residence (United Nations 1998), I moved twice: to Brisbane, Australia in 2006 and to Vienna, Austria in 2010.
<br>
<br>
Counting all international moves, I changed my country of residence 4 times (to Adelaide as an international student in 2003, return move to TÃ¼bingen in 2005, to Gold Coast as occupational trainee in 2005, and to Vienna in 2010)
<br>
<br>
Counting all changes of address within countries and across borders, I moved 11 times (not counting temporary stays with friends or relatives).

When it comes to migration flow data, definition matters!
